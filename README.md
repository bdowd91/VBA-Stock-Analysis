For this project, I created a script to loop through all stocks provided in the excel sheet. The loop took the following information:
- Ticker symbol
- Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of the year.
- The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year. 
- The total stock volume of the stock.
Conditional fotmatting was used to highlight positive change in green and negative change in red. 
The excel spreadsheet was provided to me by the Bootcamp instructors.
